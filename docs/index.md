title: Ref
---

Ref is a simple tool for collecting references and citations. I have created it for my own use, finding the more professional tools way too heavy for my simple maths blogging.

### Features
* Collect book and article references
* Store page notes
* Export the reference list to BibTeX

### Planned features
* Search the references and notes
* Export to Word
* Import references from existing sources
* Lots of polish and improvements

## Getting Ref
:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Ref is early in development!** There are lots of rough corners and potential for bugs. Essential features are missing. Data loss may occur. New versions may have trouble reading old projects. Please keep frequent backups!

That said, I am confident enough to use this tool.

## Questions and answers

### So how does it work?
You add books, articles, etc. and fill out their details. When you export the project, you get a BibTeX file you can use as a bibliography source.

You can also add pages to the entries. These are not exported, but rather serve as notes for you.

### Who and what is this?
I am Petri Laarne (polsys on GitHub, petrilaarne on Twitter), a maths student-to-be once my gap year is over, and I blog mathematics at [Nollakohta.fi](http://www.nollakohta.fi). I love sitting in the library, and created Ref as a minimal tool for taking notes for the blog and other things.

### Is this really free?
Yup. This is a tool I personally wanted to make (making things is fun), and I think sharing it has just advantages. The source code is available under the MIT license.

Of course, you're going to get only your money's worth.

### How do I get this on my Mac?
There isn't a Mac version, at least for now. I don't have a Mac. Sorry :(

### Oh, that's why it's so ugly.
That was not a question.

### BibTeX? What's that?
Other export options are planned for those who think something completely different when they hear "LaTeX".

(Actually, it exports some BibLaTeX fields as well.)

### Feature X would be *so awesome*.
I probably agree. You can peek at [the issue list](https://github.com/polsys/Ref/issues) to see if it is already planned. I'm doing this in my spare time, so the resources are limited. I'm also keeping Ref intentionally simple.

### May I help out?
Sure! Try out the tool, spread the word, file [issues](https://github.com/polsys/Ref/issues) or even whip out some code yourself.

### Can I really trust this app?
Would you trust my driving? I wouldn't use the app for a doctorate thesis without *very* frequent backups, and maybe not then either. However, I think it's very nice for smaller projects.
