# Ref

Ref is a simple reference and citation manager.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Please note:** Ref is a hobby project early in development. Do keep frequent backups for anything more serious. Data loss might occur any time.

Ref is under occasional development mostly based on user (read: my) needs.

## Features
* Collect references (books, articles, etc.)
* Store page notes
* Export the reference list to BibTeX or Word - or copy it directly from the app

## Planned features
* Search the references and notes
* Import references from existing sources
* Lots of polish and improvements

## Background
Ref is developed by @polsys, for fun and no profit. Feel free to join the fun! :books: :memo:
